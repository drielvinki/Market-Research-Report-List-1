<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Bandages Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short Stretch Bandages</li><li>Long Stretch Bandages</li><li>Multi-Layer Compression Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pressure bandages market comprises various types designed for effective compression and wound management. Short stretch bandages provide support with a limited degree of elasticity, ideal for overnight use. Long stretch bandages offer greater elasticity, allowing for dynamic compression during movement, suitable for conditions like venous insufficiency. Multi-layer compression systems combine multiple bandage layers to deliver graduated pressure, enhancing venous return and reducing edema, often used in chronic venous disorders and post-surgical recovery. Each type serves distinct therapeutic needs in patient care.</p></p>
