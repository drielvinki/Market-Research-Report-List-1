<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Bioremediation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In Situ Bioremediation</li><li>Ex Situ Bioremediation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microbial bioremediation market is divided into two main types: in situ and ex situ bioremediation. In situ bioremediation involves treating contaminants on-site, utilizing microorganisms to degrade pollutants directly within the contaminated medium, such as soil or groundwater. This method minimizes disturbance and often reduces costs. In contrast, ex situ bioremediation involves the removal of contaminated materials to a different location for treatment, allowing for controlled conditions and often more thorough remediation processes. Both methods aim to restore ecological health.</p></p>
